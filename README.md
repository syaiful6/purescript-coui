# purescript-coui

Experiments with comonads for modelling React UIs. Inspired by [paf31](https://github.com/paf31)'s
[purescript-comonad-ui](https://github.com/paf31/purescript-comonad-ui) and as exercies to understand comonads.

The difference with the original are it support side effects in response to user actions.
